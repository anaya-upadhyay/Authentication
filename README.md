# Authentication
Creating functioning Authentication by example for AspNetCore. These are primarily for learning. They aren't quite ready for production but it should be great prototypes to help you get 90% of the way there.

I have tried to include the very sources I came across that I used to help try and refresh my memory, or solve NetCore 3.x variations, or just best practices I wasn't aware of.

## AspNetCore 3.x
### C01_BasicCookie  
Project for working out a basic Cookie authentication with AspNetCore.  

[More Details in Readme](https://github.com/houseofcat/Authentication/blob/master/AspNetCore3.x/01_BasicCookie/README.md)  

### C02_CookieAuthPolicy
Project for using cookies, claims, and roles, to authenticate properly.

[More Details in Readme](https://github.com/houseofcat/Authentication/tree/master/AspNetCore3.x_MVC/C02_CookieAuthPolicy)

### I01_BasicIdentity  
Project for working out a basic Cookie authentication with AspNetCore, EntityFramework Core, and AspNetCore Identity.  

[More Details in Readme](https://github.com/houseofcat/Authentication/blob/master/AspNetCore3.x/02_BasicIdentity/README.md)  

### I02_IdentityEmailConfirm
A continuation of 02_BasicIdentity but adding in Email functionality from AspNetCore Identity and MailKit.  

[More Details in Readme](https://github.com/houseofcat/Authentication/blob/master/AspNetCore3.x/03_IdentityEmailConfirm/README.md)  

### I03_IdentityResetPassword  
A continuation of 03_IdentityEmailConfirm, making structural changes to the code, adding ForgotPassword and ResetPassword functionality.
