## Taking A Step Back
Things escalated pretty quick with all the customizations that went on, but now I want to bring the focus back  
to Authentication/Authorization.  

To do that, we are keeping Sql Server, Serilog, and other enhancements. We are removing all the custom  
replacement classes and switching back to the built-ins.
