   * Use IConfiguration (via DI in a scope) in Main.
   * Serilog console sink.
   * Serilog configuration based wire-up (SqlServer).

## Note
THIS project will start using a Database. Sql Server 2019. Which you can download and use for development purposes for free.  

Download  
1.) https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads  
2.) Click `Download 2019 Developer edition`  
3.) I have included a generic new Database Window screenshot. Super simple setup out of the box. Make sure your account is owner.  
***Alternatively, you could run the included Database build script that may or may not work for you. These things break or stop working all the time when changing versions.***  

The included CreateDatabase scripts are based on what you see in `ConnectionStrings` in `appSetttings.json`.  
I also included screen shots to give you a visual on what to expect on the final output.  

## List of Dependencies For Serilog, IdentityServer4, EF, AspNetIdentity
Please review these new dependencies and proceed when you feel comfortable with what all is what. Review Startup.cs/ConfigureExtensions.cs

**AspNetIdentity is inside NetCoreApp3.1, do not include the 2.x.x Nuget packages.**

## EntityFramework Tools
You need to have this installed on your machine.  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/cli/dotnet  

Also added package to this project (dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design)  

### Install

    dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef  

### Update

    dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef  

### Update (specific version)  

    dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef --version 3.1.2  


### Build Out Your Migrations
This will take the two classes that come from IdentityServer library and your own AppDbContext and structure out the code version of how your Database should look like.  

                                                              # Full Name Space To AppDbContext
    dotnet ef migrations add Initial_AppDbContextMigration -c IdentityServer.Data.AppDbContext -o Data/Migrations/ApplicationDb  
    dotnet ef migrations add Initial_IS4_PersistedGrantDbMigration -c PersistedGrantDbContext -o Data/Migrations/PersistedGrantDb  
    dotnet ef migrations add Initial_IS4_ConfigurationDbMigration -c ConfigurationDbContext -o Data/Migrations/ConfigurationDb  

On Startup (if Debug) will actually execute the creation of this Database plan. That is migrations in a nutshell.  
The history (of whether a migration has been ran/executed) is stored in the dbo.__efMigrationsHistory. If a migration  
has already been ran, it won't run again thanks to this table. To get it to actually run again you will have to delete  
the entries of this table (and potentially all the other objects/tables/procedures it created).
